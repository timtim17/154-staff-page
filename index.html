        Hi! I'm Austin! I'm an almost-third year student intending to major in something involving
        tech and code! I took CSE 154 in Spring 2019, and found that I absolutely loved webdev.
        This is my fourth quarter as a TA, and I'm looking forward to working with y'all as
        we all figure out this quarter together :).
      </p>
      <p>
        Interesting fact: This site is actually an updated version of my CP 1! You can see
        the original as well as my other CPs down below!
      </p>

      <h2>Why do I love 154?</h2>
      <p>
        I've always loved programming classes, and using code to do things and solve problems. Being
        able to write a little bit of code to have a computer do something is just kinda amazing to
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing that I especially love about 154 is that there are so many outlets for creativity,
        specifically in the creative projects. Though you of course can just get by doing the bare
        minimum, the CPs are a great place for you to go above and beyond, making a super awesome
        website on a topic you're passionate about. You really have the freedom to do almost
        whatever you want, and webdev has a lot to offer if you want to dive into advanced content.
        I've seen a lot of awesome, creative, and super cool projects as CPs, and I'm looking
        to seeing what you all create!

      <h2>Advice &amp; Tips for CSE 154</h2>

          <li>
            <h3>Start Early!</h3>
            <p>
              Some assignments may seem easy, while others might seem hard. Either way,
              it's always a good idea to start early to make sure you have enough time.
            </p>

          <li class="hidden">
            <h3>Read the Spec!</h3>
            <p>
              The spec is very specific and detailed, describing what your page look
              like, act like, and be like. Make sure that you complete everything
              mentioned.

          <li class="hidden">
            <h3>Stick with it!</h3>
            <p>
              Coding and webdev can be hard. But like other hard things, if you stick
              with it, keep going, and persevere, you'll eventually get through it and
              figure it out. Remember, all of the course staff are here to help you -
              feel free to reach out! You're always free to email a TA, ask on Piazza,
              or go to WPL!

          <li class="hidden">
            <h3>Lint Your Code!</h3>
            <p>
              We offer a variety of tools to make sure your code matches what we
              expect in terms of style, like
              <a href="https://oxford.cs.washington.edu/cse154/jslint/">JSLint</a>
              and the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C Validator</a>. Be sure
              to make sure you have good code style before turning it in.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="hidden">
            <h3>Explore!</h3>
            <p>
              The world of webdev is huge and ever expanding. From new frameworks to
              tools, new things are always coming out for everyone to learn, even the
              TAs. Look around, and you might find something really cool.

            <h3>Go above and beyond!</h3>
            <p>
              If you have time, feel free to go above and beyond on your creative
              projects. You might find that you've learned the skills to make something
              amazing!
