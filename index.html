        Hi! I'm Austin. I'm a third-year student interested in programming and using code to solve
        problems. I took CSE 154 in Spring 2019, and found that I absolutely loved webdev.
        This is my fifth quarter as a TA, and I'm looking forward to working with y'all, even if
        we can't be in person :).
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Why do I love 154?</h2>
      <p>
        I've always loved programming classes, and using code to do things and solve problems. Being
        able to write a little bit of code to have a computer do something is just kinda amazing to
        me.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing that I especially love about 154 is that there are so many outlets for creativity,
        specifically in the creative projects. Though you of course can just get by doing the bare
        minimum, the CPs are a great place for you to go above and beyond, making a super awesome
        website on a topic you're passionate about. You really have the freedom to do almost
        whatever you want, and webdev has a lot to offer if you want to dive into advanced content.
        I've seen a lot of awesome, creative, and super cool projects as CPs, and I'm looking forward
        to seeing what you all create!
      </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h3>Start Early!</h3>
            <p>
              Some assignments may seem easy, while others might seem hard. Either way, it's always
              a good idea to start early to make sure you have enough time.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="hidden">
            <h3>Read the Spec!</h3>
            <p>
              The spec is very specific and detailed, describing what your page look like, act like,
              and be like. Make sure that you complete everything mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
              It can be helpful to highlight important points in the spec, or otherwise reformating
              the spec in a way that's helpful to you! There's a lot of important details to make
              you follow!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="hidden">
            <h3>Stick with it!</h3>
            <p>
              Coding and webdev can be hard. But like other hard things, if you stick with it, keep
              going, and persevere, you'll eventually get through it and figure it out. Remember,
              all of the course staff are here to help you (even on Zoom ^-^) - feel free to reach
              out! You can always email a TA, ask on Ed, or go to WPL!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="hidden">
            <h3>Lint Your Code!</h3>
            <p>
              We offer a variety of tools to make sure your code matches what we expect in terms of
              style, such as the GitLab CI and Gradescope validators and tests! Be sure to make sure
              you have good code style before turning it in.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="hidden">
            <h3>Explore!</h3>
            <p>
              The world of webdev is huge and ever expanding. From new frameworks to tools, new
              things are always coming out for everyone to learn, even the TAs. Look around, and you
              might find something really cool!
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="hidden">
            <h3>Go above and beyond!</h3>
            <p>
              If you have time, feel free to go above and beyond on your creative projects. You
              might find that you've learned the skills to make something amazing!
