                Hi! I'm Austin, and I just finished my first year, including the awesome class CSE
                154 just last quarter, Spring 2019, and found that I absolutely loved webdev. Now
                I'm fortunate enough to be a part of the course staff, here to support y'all as
                students and have an awesome time with this class! I have some other experiences
                with web development, from <a href="bad.html">my first ever experience with "web
                design" as a kid years ago</a> to a more recent project, a new website for
                <a href="https://jekyll.team1294.org">my high school robotics team</a>, as well as
                my CSE 154 CPs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interesting fun fact: This site is actually an updated version of my CP 1! You can see
                the original as well as my other CPs down below!

                        <h3>Start Early!</h3>
                        <p>
                            Some assignments may seem easy, while others might seem hard. Either way,
                            it's always a good idea to start early to make sure you have enough time.

                        <h3>Stick with it!</h3>
                        <p>
                            Coding and webdev can be hard. But like other hard things, if you stick with
                            it, keep going, and persevere, you'll eventually get through it and figure 
                            it out. Remember, all of the course staff are here to help you - feel free
                            to reach out!

                        <h3>Explore!</h3>
                        <p>
                            The world of webdev is huge and ever expanding. From new frameworks to
                            tools, new things are always coming out for everyone to learn, even the TAs.
                            Look around, and you might find something really cool.

                            projects. You might find that you've learned the skills to make something
