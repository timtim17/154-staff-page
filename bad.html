  An attempt to reproduce the ugly websites I used to make
  as a kid. Intended to look horrible, though hopefully with
  modern standards.

            <p>
                As a kid, I actually grew up with a little bit of programming experience.
                At the time my dad was (and still is) a software engineer, at the time with a subscription to the
                Microsoft Developer Network, MSDN. Because of that, we were able to download a lot of interesting
                software programs to try and build "apps." At the time these "apps" did very little -- I remember
                as a kid dragging a "button" element onto a Visual Basic window and labeling it "Pepper" to "force"
                my dad to sneeze, but something I definitely did do at home was design webpages, using Microsoft
                FrontPage.
            </p>
            
            <figure>
                <img alt="Mockup of 'pepper' form" src="img/ohno/pepper.png">
                <figcaption>Artist's rendition of the "Pepper Form"</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <h2>Microsoft FrontPage 2003</h2>
            <p>
                Microsoft FrontPage, a WYSIWYG (What You See is What You Get) editor offered by Microsoft, was my
                first exposure to web design years and years ago. I remember making a group of websites, each under
                the same theme and structure, for a group of fictitious businesses. I remember pulling the exact
                clip art I wanted, and going through different wizards to pick what button styles I wanted and
                how I wanted the table layout to work, and as a kid I was pretty proud of those websites.
            </p>

            <p>
                Over time those websites have gone, as the old hard drive got infected and died. But I will always
                remember using FrontPage all those years ago, one of my key stepping stones to creating things on
                the computer. While I can't find the exact clip art logo, or the exact button styles, I've tried
                my best here to show what those old sites used to look like, except this time with actually valid
                and hand-made CSS and HTML. There are some actual HTML5 features here now, like the semantic
                <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> tags used for the buttons on the left. The design may look cringy and
                horrible today, but these designs were a part of my childhood that put me on a path towards
                creating and coding.
